# Detecting-Plant-Disease-using-MobileNet
Image classification AI for detecting plant disease from leaves using MobileNet TF

Welcome to this repo.

Here is an outline of the file here and how you can use them.

1. Model1_disease_detection_using_mobilenet_tl.ipynb - pre-processing, training and validation algorithm for Model 1
2. Model2_plant_disease_detection_using_mobilenet_tl.ipynb - training and validation algorithm for Model 2
3. Modelx_plant_disease_detection_using_Mobilenet - training and validation algorithm for Model X
4. Plant_disease_model_testing(BGImages).ipynb - testing algorithm for Model 1 & 2 (tomato leaf test images with background)
5. Plant_disease_model_testing(No_BGImages).ipynb - testing algorithm for Model 1 & 2 (no background tomato leaf test images)
6. README.md - Here already!
7. Remove_Image_Background.ipynb - Simple algorithm to automatically remove backgrounds from a collection of image leaves.
8. Viva presentation.pdf - A slideshow presentation in pdf, displaying the results and concusion of this work.
