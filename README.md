INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the repository for my master's project in Data Science.

Project Title: Automated Plant Disease Identification for Mobile and Edge Devices Using Deep Learning

The primary objective of this project is to revolutionize and enhance the field of agriculture by utilizing deep learning techniques and leveraging the capabilities of mobile and edge devices.

Traditionally, the identification of plant diseases has relied on manual inspection by experts, which is a time-consuming, expensive, and often limited process in terms of scalability.

However, with the widespread availability of mobile devices and advancements in data processing capabilities, there is an exciting opportunity to develop a convenient and accessible solution. Imagine farmers being able to identify crop diseases simply by capturing a photo with their mobile phones.

In this repository, you will find various files related to the project, including documentation, code, and datasets. These resources will guide you on how to use them effectively.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to explore the contents of this repository!
